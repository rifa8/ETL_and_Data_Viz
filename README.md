# üöÄ ELT Process

**>>>If you want to use airbyte to ingest data, you can use [airbyte branch](https://github.com/CharisChakim/Membership-Optimization-and-Business-Performance-Analysis-of-XYZ-Firm/tree/airbyte)**

# üìç Analysis Result

1. Ensure accurate tracking of PT. XYZ's membership growth and historical data annually from 2019 to 2022.

    ![alt text](images/image-1.png)

    **Overall growth**: Membership has grown steadily from 19 in 2019 to 96 in 2021, representing a growth more than 5 times over the three-year period. In the last year, growth has decreased quite significantly, around 35%, so that the total number of members currently stands at 240 members 

    ![alt text](images/image-7.png)
    **Growth** : The chart shows a steady increase in the number of memberships approved over a two-year period, from around 500 in January 2020 to around 2,500 in January 2022. This represents a significant growth of approximately 400%. This suggests that the organization has been successful in attracting new members.
    
2. Calculate the churn rate to find out the annual number of memberships discontinuing their subscriptions to PT. XYZ.

    ![alt text](images/image-2.png)

    **Overall churn rate**: The overall churn rate has decreased steadily over the four years, from 3.36% in 2019 to 2.47% in 2022. This indicates that the service has been successful in retaining its subscribers over time.

    **Year-over-year changes**: The largest decrease in churn rate occurred between 2019 and 2020, with a drop of almost 1%. The churn rate remained relatively stable between 2020 and 2022.

3. Converting and consolidating all payment transactions into revenue calculations in a single currency (USD).

    We can use **from forex_python.converter import CurrencyRates** library for do this, the converting will do base on realtime currency because the currency will always change day to day.

    ![alt text](images/image-5.png)

    so when we check on database will no more other currencies

4. Visualize the distribution of memberships based on state, key account manager, and membership plan.

    ![alt text](images/image-3.png)

    In this map, we can see if our biggest member was on west virginia, New Mexico,Wyoming,  and Maine with total more than 6k member from any membership plan in that state.

    ![alt text](images/image-4.png)

    We can see based on the table, If **West Virginia** has the **most members with gold plan** with 3,741 members and **Alice** as account manager there.

    **New Mexico is the 3rd largest** member with 2,559 members with silver membership. **Agus budi** dominate in 2 state in 3 largest membership based on membership plan
